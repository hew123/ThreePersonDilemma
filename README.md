# ThreePersonDilemma

Objective: The goal of this project is for students to develop a simple bot in Java, with a strategy that can help it earn as much score as possible in a tournament with other bots made by other students.


In the classic Prisoner’s Dilemma instance, the best strategy is known to be to defect. However, when this game is repeated involving several rounds, cooperating emerges to become the best strategy to earn as much score as possible. This is because those defecting against each other will receive the lowest score in comparison with those who cooperate with each other through multiple rounds, and end up receiving relatively higher score. Then, the 2-prisoners’ dilemma is further extended to become a 3-prisoners’ dilemma in this assignment.
